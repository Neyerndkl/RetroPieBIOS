# RetroPieBIOS

BIOS files collection for [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk) (current updated for RetroPie version 4.6).

[RetroPie's Docs](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/BIOS/) says:

    Supported bios files for the libretro cores can be scanned using the official Bios.dat from Libretro-database

The file `Bios.dat` was renamed to [System.dat](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/blob/master/dat/System.dat) in the repository [RetroArch Database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database), and in this repository the file `bios.dat` is a copy of it.

`bios.dat` says it lists `System, firmware, or BIOS files used by libretro`. With google's help files were collected from the web and saved into the folder `bios/` and md5 hash values were verified. May copying all these bios files into your RetroPie's bios folder helps to run your games!
